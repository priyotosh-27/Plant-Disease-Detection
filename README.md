# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural professionals detect diseases early and take appropriate actions.

## 🧠 Features

- Image-based disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Trained on a large dataset of plant leaf images
- Predicts common plant diseases with good accuracy
- Easy-to-use code for training, testing, and deploying the model

  📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled plant leaf images across various disease categories. Make sure to unzip the dataset file before training.

🖼️ Sample Predictions
The model takes an input image of a plant leaf and outputs the predicted disease class.

🚀 Future Improvements
Deploy the model using a web interface (Flask or Streamlit)

Add support for real-time webcam prediction

Improve accuracy with advanced architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
